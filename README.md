# Image search

The **Image search project** is a front-end part of a keyword search and image
viewer application. The user will enter a search string in the text field, and
when submitting the form, an HTTP request is made.

For HTTP requests the axios library is used.

The project demonstrates the use of back-end queries with async/await syntax.

## There were used:

- Axios
- Notiflix
- API Pixabay
- SimpleLightbox
